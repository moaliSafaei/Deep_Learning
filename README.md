# Deep Learning

This repository contains practical examples of neural networks ranged from basic networks to complex ones all written in jupyter notebook.
Such examples are useful for graduate students who are trying to get familiar with artificial intelligence.

The first example illustrates a simple MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) architecture. 
2. The second one contains a CNN which is useful for for classifying pictures.

### MLP
A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. It consists of fully connected neurons organized into at least three layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer
### CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized deep learning algorithm used for tasks like image classification and object recognition. Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs automatically learn features through filter optimization. They excel at identifying patterns in images and are widely used in computer vision and machine learning applications.
