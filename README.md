# Deep_Learning

This repository contains practical examples of neural networks ranged from basic networks to complex ones all written in jupyter notebook.
Such examples are useful for graduate students who are trying to get familiar with artificial intelligence.

1. The first example illustrates a simple MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) architecture. 
2. The second one contains a CNN which is useful for for classifying pictures.
