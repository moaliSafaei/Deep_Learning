# Traffic Sign Recognition problem

AI-driven self-driving cars enhance road safety by reducing human error, adapting to changing environments, and predicting traffic patterns. Additionally, they provide mobility solutions for people with disabilities. In this manner, traffic sign recognition is of great importance. It is crucial for intelligent navigation and seamless interaction with surroundings, which ultimately advances autonomous vehicle safety and efficiency.<br>
A practical example of this problem is presented here. It can be viewed as a valuable exercise for undergraduates and researchers working on applied AI projects.<br>
