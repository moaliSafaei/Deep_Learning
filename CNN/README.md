# Traffic Sign Recognition problem

AI-driven self-driving cars enhance road safety by reducing human error and minimizing accidents. These vehicles adapt to changing environments and predict traffic patterns using AI algorithms. Moreover, they offer mobility solutions for people with disabilities, promoting inclusivity.
Here is an example of CNN netwroks. This can be seen as a practice for undergraduates. Also, researchers who are working on applied AI projects can profit from it.
